# Food Database
Welcome to the foodguide database application which is created for people who love people looking for eating in different locations around New Zealand.
This Database was made for eductional purposes and as an assessment for NCEA Digital Technologies in Level 3 standards. FoodGuide Database is 
a fictional app created for school assessment purposes.

<h1>Description</h1>
I decided to build this kind of database is because most of the time when we go to a restaurant some foods are not been sold that restaurant anymore so I decided to build this application so people can check the database before going to buy the food so they won’t be disappointed when the food they wanted isn’t there and also this would save time because the customer won’t be going to the wrong restaurant to get a food the restaurant don’t sell anymore or is out of stock.
